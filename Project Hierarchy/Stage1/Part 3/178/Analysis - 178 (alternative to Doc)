Binary Layer 0 – along face bounds

Left rotation (04) – xC decreased, yC increased.
Right rotation - centroid moved higher
Smile – small difference too
Median filter – difference is small

Binary Layer 1 – skin pixels
Left – xC changed more compared to yC
Right – no dramatic changes, a bit more xC increased
Smile – no dramatic changes

Binary Layer 2 – central region around nose, eyebrows and lips

Left - no big changes, xC+, yC-
Right – almost same
Smile – almost same, however I expected increased yC

Binary Layer 3 – lips and ears

Left – almost same
Right – same
Smile – almost same too. Also expected centroid to get higher

So we may conclude that head rotations mostly affect on boundaries. 
Application of the average filter mostly have no effect on centroid position.
